# Example data
This is some example data to get started with the system easily.

To get started, move examples/anime.test.json to configuration/environments/anime.test.json
and move examples/configuration.json to configuration/configuration.json.

You can then run `php anime/Services/execute.php` to generate the data the application uses.

Log in with "Some Volunteer", "Some Senior" or "Some Staff".
