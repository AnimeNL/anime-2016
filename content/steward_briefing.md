# Steward briefing
The official kick-off meeting for the stewards of Anime 2018, which you are required to attend.

During this meeting we will introduce you to **Neil** and **Peter**, Security and Steward Staff,
and to the steward leadership consisting of **Ferdi**, **Martine**, **Nardo** and **Remy**. We’ll
also introduce you to the security and first-aid teams, as well as our partners at the World Forum.

We’ll give you an overview of our expectations of you as a steward, of **stewards.team**, the most
important shifts, and will finish by giving you the opportunity to ask any remaining questions.
