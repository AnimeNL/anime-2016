# Steward briefing
The briefing is the official kick off for your duties as a steward at Anime 2017!

We'll introduce you to our friends at the World Forum, the Security and First Aid teams and of
course your fellow steward team. You'll get a quick reminder of the most important aspects of
your duties as a steward and the chance to ask any question that's on your mind.

After the briefing, you'll pick up your safety vest, your walkie talkie and start your adventureâ€¦
